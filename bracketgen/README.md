Output standard output or output.txt

Given an integer n. It is required to derive all the correct bracket sequences of length 2 ⋅ n, ordered lexicographically

Only parentheses are used in the task.

It is advisable to obtain a solution that works in a time proportional to the total number of correct bracket sequences in the response, and at the same time uses a memory capacity proportional to n.
Input format

The only line of the input file contains an integer n, 0 ≤ n ≤ 11
Output format
